Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(person("Bernard", "Shek", email = "bernard.shek@mail.utoronto.ca", role = c("aut", "cre")), person("Dian", "Zhang", role = "aut"))
Description: Computes the crude odds/risk ratio (OR/RR) and stratum-specific odds/risk ratios by a specified confounder using raw exposure and outcome vectors.
    This function automates the construction of two-way contingency tables with totals and provides odds/risk ratio estimates with 95% confidence intervals.
